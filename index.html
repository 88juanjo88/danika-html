    <h1>PERU TRAVEL</h1>
    <h2>About Peru</h2>
    <p>Peru is one of the world’s most varied countries. It is a multicultural nation, filled with traditions, a unique
      gastronomy and vast natural reserves. It is home to 12 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and 84 of the planet’s 117 life
      zones. Peru is situated in the western part of South America and shares borders with Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil,
      Bolivia and Chile. Its enormous territory, covering more than 1.2 million square kilometers, is composed of three
      regions: Coast, Highlands and Jungle. Its current population exceeds 31.5 million inhabitants.</p>
    <h2>Tourism</h2>
    <p>Thanks to a long history defined by major ancient civilizations, Peru is home to more than 5000 archaeological
      sites. Many of these remain shrouded in mystery, but are still capable of transporting visitors to the periods
      when such societies flourished. For example, a visit to Machu Picchu reveals the perfection of the Inca empire;
      this sacred city can be reached onboard the luxurious trains that run through imposing mountain scenery dotted
      with colorful Andean villages.</p>
    <p>Peru is synonymous with natural beauty and it is one of the world’s ten most biologically diverse countries. With
      more than 200 protected natural areas, it possesses 84 of the planet’s 117 life zones. Peru has created 14
      national parks, 15 national reserves, 9 national sanctuaries and 11 reserved zones. It is home to more than 1800
      species of birds and 10% of all the reptile, mammal and fish species that exist on Earth. It also has 3 500
      varieties of orchids.</p>
    <p>Peru is also a paradise for lovers of adventure, offering a range of outdoor sporting activities for the curious,
      beginners, amateurs and experts, including trekking, climbing, mountain biking, surfing, paragliding, hang
      gliding, camping, canoeing and kayaking. These are just some of the most popular activities that form part of the
